#Design a project where as an input student will give a static number (between 1 to 6) and then
#roll the dice which randomly generate some value between 1 to 6. The winning situation arrives
#when the given static/fixed number exactly same to the number came after rolling the dice.
#User can play the game as many numbers of times he wants until user wants to exit, and
#whenever winning situation occur some scores must be given to the user, and these scores goes
#on adding if user play this game multiple number of times.
#Note: Dice contains face valueâ€™s (1 to 6)
#Hint: Make use of random.randint() function
